# Sun_Pointing_Lyapunov
Implementation of paper "A Hybrid Control Method for Sun Pointing and Spin-Axis Stabilization of Magnetorquer-Actuated Spacecraft"

This repository contains an implementation of single and Monte-Carlo simulations of a magnetorquer-only Sun-pointing controller with guarantees of convergence that was flown . This work is being submitted to the 2025 IEEE aerospace conference. We also provide a Jupyter notebook with examples.
